# Magnetic Market
Project work done as part of the Insight Data Science, January 2020 cohort

Please see `project_prospectus.md` for a detailed description of the project, including motivation, implementation and file structure. 

This project utilizies a data-driven approach to provide suggestions for organizers of farmers markets on what events to organize alongside the market itself. Farmers market attendance has stagnated over the last 5 years. It has been shown that one of the ways to encourage increased attendance is to have events of interest to the community a the location of the market. The data shows that nearly 70% of all events are music related; this choice of event may not be commensurate with the needs and desires of the local community. Magnetic Market uses twitter data to find topics of interest to occasional farmers market shoppers to add that extra boost of attraction to attending, based on a real-time, location-specific, data-driven approach.
