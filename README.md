# farmers-market
Project work done as part of the Insight Data Science, January 2020 cohort

Ideas:

* Maybe I can use it to identify low income users. Or target it towards lower income users.

* Free health screenings, yoga classes, outdoor cooking classes, lectures and
talks on social issues such as climate change and sustainability. 

* Shoppers are unable to do all their shopping - so maybe increase product space depending on what other products people want. 

* Increased options for socialization

* Philadelphia seems really cool! It works!

# Things to do:

1) Quickly sample through what the other cities look like. I can then always pick cities and have some data processing and management pipeline to make things work. 

2) How can I export and save models? Although this doesn't take too long. See [here](https://stackoverflow.com/questions/17354417/gensim-how-to-save-lda-models-produced-topics-to-a-readable-format-csv-txt-et)

3) See ways to visualize this better with pyLDAvis. 

3) Still do some exploratory data analysis and go back and forth between omitted words.

4)
