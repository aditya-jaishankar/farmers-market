# farmers-market
Project work done as part of the Insight Data Science, January 2020 cohort

Ideas:

* Maybe I can use it to identify low income users. Or target it towards lower income users.

* Free health screenings, yoga classes, outdoor cooking classes, lectures and
talks on social issues such as climate change and sustainability. 

* Shoppers are unable to do all their shopping - so maybe increase product space depending on what other products people want. 

* Increased options for socialization
